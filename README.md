### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brendan McCormack and I am in my (as of 2024), second semester of my sophmore year.

## Interests and Hobbys:
  While I generally love anything that I can ADHD tunnel vision on, when it comes to hobbies and intersts I do have a great deal. When it comes to interacting with others I have discovered a big interest in Board Games and TTRPGS, while reading, running, and video games are more of a solitary hobby.
  
## Why Computer Science:
  I am actually minoring in computer science, my major is Electical Engineering. This is because it allows for me to better understand many different aspects of the field and hopefully come out with both a physical and programming knowledge to be better well rounded.
